## Getting Started 🏁

This project was designed using **Quartus Lite** and simulated in **ModelSim**. To get started:

1. **Clone the repository** 📂

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sim43/Sim43-8-bit-RISC-Microcontroller-Verilog.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory** 📁

   ```bash
   cd Sim43-8-bit-RISC-Microcontroller-Verilog

3. **Open the project in Quartus Lite** 🛠️

4. **Simulate the project using ModelSim** 🧪

## Prerequisites 📋

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition** 🎛️  
- **ModelSim Simulator** 🖥️  

## Usage 🚦
